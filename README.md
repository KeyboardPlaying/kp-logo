## Graphical chart

The background and elements must be a combination of three colors. Those were determined as part of the new KP graphical chart built with [Material Design Lite](http://www.getmdl.io/customize/index.html).

|   Color |  R  |  G  |  B  |
| ------: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Primary |  96 | 125 | 139 |
|  Accent | 255 | 110 |  64 |
|   White | 255 | 255 | 255 |

## `logo-normal-elements.svg`

The file exist in the `rsc`. You can see it [here](https://github.com/KeyboardPlaying/kp-logo/blob/master/rsc/logo-normal-elements.svg)

The extrusions are materialized as yellow objects to make edition easier. This means some manual work is required to get the final logo.

## To do

* [ ] Add styles (`kp-logo--bg`, `kp-logo--primary`, `kp-logo--accent`) to allow easier color manipulation when used inside page
